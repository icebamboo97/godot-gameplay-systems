Gameplay Attributes
===================

It is very simple (dead simple enough I would say, longer to write and read than to use):

You in-game entities which should have some kind of attributes (life, endurance, mana, stamina, jump force etc) must have a `GameplayAttributeMap` node.

You have to specify both a `owning character` property assigning a node.

This node accepts an `AttributeTable` resource as value. This resource specifies which attributes the entity has.

Once specified a table, the inspector will show you these attributes, where you can set a:

- minimum value: which usually is zero
- maximum value: if you set it to zero, there will be not a maximum
- current value: the starting value for the entity

Now, to change these attributes, you will need some kind of "effects", in the form of `GameplayEffect` nodes.

A `GameplayEffect` requires an `AttributeTable` resource (like `GameplayAttributeMap`) and can specify an unlimited number of attributes alterations to it.

Once you setupped your `GameplayEffect`, you can add it to the character and here the magic happens, the attributes are changed magically.

You can use `EffectedArea2D` or `EffectedArea3D` to automatically apply effects on collisions (although you should extend them to validate to who you should apply the effect)

Done, more simple than previous versions.
